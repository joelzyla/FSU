// ***SAVE DATA FUNCTION***
// Write a saveData function that saves all data input into the form into Local Storage.
// This means the values for your input, select, radio or checkboxes etc.
// You should also save a key(random number) for your values(array or object). Each saved entry will be a key:value pair.
// The key should be a random number which will create a unique id.
// The value should be an array or object that contains all the values of your form field data.
// This allows for our form to save multiple submissions into Local Storage without overwriting data.
// Remember you can test your local storage by using the Web Inspector

// ***GET DATA***
// Once data has been submitted through the form, we can grab the data submitted from Local Storage. 
// List out your saved data from Local Storage on the additem.html document using the Display Data link you created. 
// Make sure you hide the form when you display your data on screen as shown in the example screenshots. 
// You can use these the following screenshots as a guideline. 
// Your project's screen will vary from this example based on your topic.

// ***CLEAR DATA***
// Create a function that removes all data from local storage.
// Be sure to create a clear data link or button in your app that runs the function that removes all data.

// ***ARRAY FUNCTION***
// Write an array function(s) that populates at least one select form element. 
// This probably will be for your categories but you may have more select fields for other things depending on the topic you chose. 
// This will REPLACE your static HTML select element(s) so that you can see an alterative way to create HTML elements.
